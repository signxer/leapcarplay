# LeapCarPlay

**LeapCarPlay is a community fork of DiPlay/xcertplay**, adapted for Leapmotor Android head units with a separate CarPlay cluster display. The Android application ID remains `com.shihab.diplay` to preserve the existing Wi-Fi Direct namespace and integrations.

## Leapmotor secondary display

When Android exposes an HDMI2 presentation display, LeapCarPlay advertises CarPlay's optional cluster stream and renders it on that display. The iPhone and navigation app control whether map content is sent to the cluster. See [compatibility notes](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md).

This fork does not yet publish a LeapCarPlay APK release. Build instructions are in [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).

## Upstream 0.2.0 preview notes

Install on the **car**, not the iPhone. No jailbreak, dongle, Mac, account or authentication server is required for use. ADB is not needed during everyday use; your head unit must permit APK installation. Wireless supports Wi-Fi Direct or the car’s existing hotspot; Wi-Fi Direct requires Android 10+; the APK supports Android 9+ for wired use.

- Wired USB and wireless CarPlay with local authentication.
- BYD HUD navigation with arrows, distance and street names on verified firmware.
- Car hotspot support, improved audio buffering and saved receive diagnostics.
- Automatic address discovery, fixed-channel Wi-Fi fallbacks and successful-configuration memory.
- Icon/text size, resolution and frame rate; applying a display change reconnects CarPlay.
- Local diagnostic export. Reports are sent only if you choose to share them.
- Separate installation alongside DiAuto. Run one projection app at a time.

This is **not an Apple-certified product**. The APK bundles an experimental accessory identity recovered from public Carlinkit firmware, not a newly provisioned MFi identity for LeapCarPlay. A bundled private key is extractable. Acceptance after future iOS updates, reliability across head units and suitability of that identity for general distribution are unresolved. This release invites community testing; it is not a guarantee of universal compatibility.

The release changes were tested on the development DiLink5.1 car: live windshield guidance and street names work, Car hotspot now starts CarPlay, and Wi-Fi Direct performance is substantially improved. Occasional audio cutouts remain and are deferred to a later update. Broader head-unit and iOS compatibility is not guaranteed. The HUD firmware scope and cleanup limits are documented in [BYD navigation](docs/BYD_NAVIGATION.md).

The home/settings UI and website adapt [DiAuto](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiAuto), AGPL-3.0; that license is included in `docs/licenses`.

This repository starts with a clean public source snapshot. Local research, tester reports and release-signing secrets are excluded. The complete source corresponding to the APK is provided with every release; experimental runtime identity assets are described separately in the build instructions and notices.

## Local release packaging

The release APK intentionally contains the experimental accessory identity. The Git repository and source archive exclude all accessory and Android signing keys; tests generate synthetic identities at runtime. Source/CI builds omit runtime identity assets by default. Local release builds explicitly select an external asset directory. Publishing the APK makes its bundled identity extractable; building locally does not preserve that identity's confidentiality.
